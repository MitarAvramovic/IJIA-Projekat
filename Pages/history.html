            <h3>Origins in Ethiopia</h3>
            <p>
                The story of coffee begins in Ethiopia, where legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing 
                effects of coffee beans around the 9th century. Kaldi observed his goats becoming unusually lively after eating red 
                berries from a particular shrub. Curious, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar burst of energy. 
                This discovery eventually caught the attention of local monks, who used the berries to stay awake during long hours of prayer.

            <h3>The Spread to the Arab World</h3>
            <p>
                By the 15th century, coffee cultivation and trade had spread to the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen became a major hub for 
                coffee production, and Sufi monasteries played a key role in popularizing the beverage for its stimulating properties 
                during spiritual practices. Coffeehouses, known as "qahveh khaneh," began to appear in cities like Mecca and Medina. 
                These establishments became social centers for conversation, music, and games, fostering a unique coffee culture.

            <h3>Introduction to Europe</h3>
            <p>
                In the 16th century, coffee made its way to Europe through Venetian merchants who traded with the Ottoman Empire. 
                Initially met with suspicion and sometimes referred to as the "bitter invention of Satan," coffee gained acceptance 
                after Pope Clement VIII reportedly tasted and approved it. By the 17th century, coffeehouses began to spring up 
                across Europe, becoming hubs for intellectual exchange. In England, they were famously dubbed "penny universities" 
                because patrons could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in stimulating discussions.

            <h3>Expansion to the Americas</h3>
            <p>
                The global expansion of coffee cultivation began in the 17th and 18th centuries, driven by European colonial powers. 
                The Dutch were instrumental in introducing coffee plants to their colonies in Java (Indonesia), while the French brought 
                coffee to the Caribbean. Brazil emerged as a dominant coffee producer in the 19th century, thanks to its favorable 
                climate and large-scale plantations.

            <h3>Coffee in Modern Times</h3>
            <p>
                Today, coffee is grown in more than 70 countries, primarily in regions near the equator known as the "Coffee Belt." 
                Advances in roasting techniques, brewing methods, and the rise of specialty coffee have transformed the industry. 
                Coffeehouses like Starbucks have popularized global coffee culture, blending traditional practices with modern trends. 
                Additionally, coffee has become a key commodity in the global economy, supporting millions of farmers worldwide.
