        <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
        <p>Coffee's origins trace back to the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia. Legend has it that a goat herder named
            Kaldi discovered coffee when his goats became energized after eating berries from a certain tree.</p>
        <p>From Ethiopia, coffee spread to Yemen, where it became integral to Sufi rituals. By the 15th century,
            coffeehouses emerged in the Middle East, and the drink quickly gained global popularity.</p>
